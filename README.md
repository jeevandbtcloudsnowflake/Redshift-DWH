# E-Commerce Data Warehouse Project

## Overview
A comprehensive end-to-end data warehouse solution for an e-commerce platform using Amazon Redshift, implementing modern ETL practices with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).

## Architecture
This project demonstrates:
- **Amazon Redshift** data warehouse with optimized star schema
- **AWS Glue** ETL pipelines for data processing
- **Terraform** Infrastructure as Code
- **Python/SQL** for data transformations
- **CI/CD** pipelines with GitHub Actions
- **Data Quality** monitoring and validation
- **Performance Optimization** techniques
