## 📊 **Project Templates for Data Warehouse**

### **Template 1: Development Workflow**
```
Backlog → Planning → Development → Testing → Review → Done → Deployed
```

### **Template 2: Agile Sprints**
```
Product Backlog → Sprint Backlog → In Progress → Review → Done
```

### **Template 3: Operations Focus**
```
Incidents → Investigating → Fixing → Testing → Resolved → Monitoring
```

## 🎯 **Best Practices for Data Warehouse Projects**

### **1. Issue Labeling**
Use labels to categorize work:
- 🏗️ `infrastructure` - Infrastructure changes
- 📊 `analytics` - BI and reporting
- 🔧 `devops` - DevOps and automation
- 🐛 `bug` - Bug fixes
- ✨ `enhancement` - New features
- 🔒 `security` - Security improvements
- 📈 `performance` - Performance optimization

### **2. Milestones**
Create milestones for major releases:
- 🎯 **v1.0 - MVP** (Basic data warehouse)
- 🎯 **v1.1 - Analytics** (BI dashboards)
- 🎯 **v1.2 - Automation** (Full DevOps)
- 🎯 **v2.0 - Advanced** (ML and real-time)

### **3. Automation**
Set up automation rules:
- **Auto-move** issues when PRs are merged
- **Auto-close** issues when linked PRs are merged
- **Auto-assign** based on labels

## 🔗 **Linking Projects to Repositories**

### **Connect Your Redshift-DWH Repository**
1. **In your project**, click "Settings"
2. **Linked repositories** → "Link a repository"
3. **Select**: `Redshift-DWH`
4. **Enable**: Auto-add issues and PRs

### **Benefits of Linking**
- ✅ **Issues** automatically appear in project
- ✅ **Pull requests** can be tracked
- ✅ **Commits** can reference issues
- ✅ **Progress** is automatically updated

## 📈 **Project Metrics and Reporting**

### **Track These Metrics**
- 📊 **Velocity** - Issues completed per sprint
- 📈 **Burndown** - Work remaining over time
- 🎯 **Cycle time** - Time from start to completion
- 🔄 **Throughput** - Issues completed per week

### **Generate Reports**
- **Weekly status** updates
- **Sprint retrospectives**
- **Milestone progress** reports
- **Team performance** metrics

## 🎯 **Sample Project Setup for Your Data Warehouse**
